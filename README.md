- Toggle reading status (Will Read → Currently Reading → Finished)
- Modal-based form interface
- Dynamic card-based layout with CSS Grid
- Unique UUID generation for book tracking

## 🛠️ Built With

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Constructor functions, array methods, closures, event delegation
- **CSS3** - Grid, Flexbox, animations, custom properties
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and forms
- **Font Awesome** - Icon library

## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Object-oriented design with constructor functions and prototypes
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- State management for edit mode tracking
- Dynamic DOM rendering from data array
- Event handling and delegation patterns
- CSS transitions and animations for better UX

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start managing your reading list!

## 🎯 What I Learned

This project strengthened my understanding of core JavaScript fundamentals including array manipulation (`find`, `findIndex`, `splice`), DOM creation and manipulation, closure scope in event listeners, and separating data logic from UI rendering. I also practiced implementing smooth user interactions with CSS animations and modal patterns.
